- Organized the repo and added design_wiki0.pdf.
Feedback received for design_wiki0.pdf:
- Generally, the diagrams and information were good.
- The component map we made for this was actually a site map. Component maps should include backend information.

- added the description of the website/app and the launch codes to README.md.

- added initial app skeleton for the project
- added temporary templates to serve as a login feature (will change SOON)

roshaniS -- 2021-10-30 18:08
- added additional templates (register.html, userblog.html)
- modified templates to match variables in __init__.py
- modified __init__.py so that it could create a simple working site with login capabilities

- added back actual design_wiki0.pdf
- fixed because the previous pdf was actually of the first version of our design document (for the web log hosting site)
- feedback from that design wiki document is in my first devlog entry

- Added correct design_wiki1.pdf
  - Feedback:
    - Most the design document lacked the needed clarity to proceed (components, database organization, maps)
    - Site map was too tiny to read
- Updated requirements.txt so that user can use the file to install the required packages
