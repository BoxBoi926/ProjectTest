I organized the repo and added design_wiki0.pdf.
Feedback received for design_wiki0.pdf:
- Generally, the diagrams and information were good.
- The component map we made for this was actually a site map. Component maps should include backend information.

I added the description of the website/app and the launch codes to README.md.
