- Organized the repo and added design_wiki0.pdf.
Feedback received for design_wiki0.pdf:
- Generally, the diagrams and information were good.
- The component map we made for this was actually a site map. Component maps should include backend information.

- added the description of the website/app and the launch codes to README.md.

- Added design_wiki1 to the repo

- added initial app skeleton for the project
- added temporary templates to serve as a login feature (will change SOON)

roshaniS -- 2021-10-30 18:08
- added additional templates (register.html, userblog.html)
- modified templates to match variables in __init__.py
- modified __init__.py so that it could create a simple working site with login capabilities

- added back actual design_wiki0.pdf
- fixed because the previous pdf was actually of the first version of our design document (for the web log hosting site)
- feedback from that design wiki document is in my first devlog entry

- Added correct design_wiki1.pdf
  - Feedback:
    - Most the design document lacked the needed clarity to proceed (components, database organization, maps)
    - Site map was too tiny to read
- Updated requirements.txt so that user can use the file to install the required packages

thomasY -- 2021-10-31 18:54
- Updated README with more detailed launch codes

thomasY -- 2021-10-31 21:27
- Fixed issues with launch codes
  - Wasn't in the correct directory when installing requirements
  - Replaced pip with pip3

austinN -- 2021-11-01 09:22
- added initial skeleton for database creation of users and their login info

roshaniS -- 2021-11-01 19:03
- added loginpage.py to display the login and register pages
- moved the code from __init__.py to loginpage.py but kept the original code in __init__.py (will change this soon)
- modified the code so that logging in would allow the user to stay at the root
- removed the condition for "GET" 
- added the register button and the functions associated with it
- fixed the logout function so that it redirects the user to the root and not just renders the login.html template

roshaniS -- 2021-11-01 19:07
- fixed the errors that were present in loginpage.py ("UnboundLocalError: local variable 'tempUser' referenced before assignment")
  - these errors were present in the disp_loginpage() and authenticate() functions
  - moved the sections of code after tempUser and tempPass were assigned back under the if statement checking if request.method == 'POST' 
  - in the disp_loginpage() function: all the code below the variable assignments mentioned above up until "if "user" in session"
  - in the authenticate() function: all the code below the variable assignments mentioned above up until the end of the function
